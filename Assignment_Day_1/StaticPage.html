    <h1>Self-Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>Swathi Byrisetty</b> and I am from Nellore, which is in Andhra Pradesh. I have been completed my Bachelor of Technology at Sree Venkateswara College of Engineering in the stream of Electronics and Communication Department. During my B. Tech I have gained practical experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, and MySQL through both online and offline learning. To put my skills into practice, I worked on my personal projects like my own portfolio, Bank Application, and Job finder, which enhanced my technical ability. During my final year, I did an internship through Internshala trainings which is a online platform, where I got hands-on exposure to real-world projects. This experience thought me how to handle challenges and adopt as a beginner in the new field.  Apart from my technical journey, I kept intrest on learning new things, doing physical exercise and exploring music which refreshes my mind and allowes me to be focused. Coming to goals my short term goal is to secure a job in a reputable company where I can apply my technical and development skills in a real world entity and my long term goal is to step into a leadership role where I can guide a team and contribute meaningfully to the growth of the organization.</p>
